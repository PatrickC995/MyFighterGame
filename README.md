# MyFighterGame
Simple game that allows the player to fight a variety of enemies, gain xp and level up.

> Note - The master branch is treated as the main branch

Players can create an account which will save their progress to a text file. As they adventure, they’ll encounter a variety of enemies—from formidable knights to sly rats and swift bats. Before each battle, players must strategize: fight for glory or flee to safety. While fleeing grants no rewards, every victory earns valuable experience points (XP). As XP builds up, players will level up, boosting their stats.
